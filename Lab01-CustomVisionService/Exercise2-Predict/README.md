## Accessing the prediction endpoint using REST API

In this step, you will learn how to access the REST prediction endpoint that was created by Custom Vision Service as a wrapper around your model. The instructor will explain in detail what the prediction endpoint is and will walk you through `predict.ipynb` Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to use Python SDK to access the service.

1. Make sure to mark the current version of your model as the default iteration.

2. Log in to Jupyter Lab on your DSVM

3. Navigate to `MTC_AzureAILabs/Lab01-CustomVisionService/Exercise2-Predict` and start `predict.ipynb`

4. Walk-through the notebook following the instructor
